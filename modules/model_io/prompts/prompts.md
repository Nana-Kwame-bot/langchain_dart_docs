# Prompts

A prompt for a language model is a set of instructions or input provided by a user to guide the model's response, helping it understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based output, such as answering questions, completing sentences, or engaging in a conversation.

LangChain provides several classes and functions to make constructing and working with prompts easy.

- [Prompt templates](/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/prompt_templates.md): parametrize model inputs.
- [Example selectors](/modules/model_io/prompts/example_selectors/example_selectors.md): dynamically select examples to include in prompts.
